# EmbeddedProgramming
 
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**<br>
This project utilizes CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL and Code Composer to create an embedded thermostat that sends data to a server. The I2C interface is used to read the temperature sensor. The GPIO interface controls the LEDs that indicate when the heat is on or off. The UART interface outputs data to simulate data being sent to a server.<br> 
This project was created to showcase my ability to write interface software to control hardware components and analyze the hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance.<br><br> 
**What did you do particularly well?**<br>
Beyond properly implementing the functional interface protocols, I created an efficient timer that provides interrupts to gather data at specific intervals.<br><br>
**Where could you improve?**<br>
I could improve this project by implementing a Wi-Fi protocol to transfer data to a server. <br><br>
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**<br>
This project provided many opportunities to work on transferable skills. The project followed a prompt that provided requirements from a simulated business. Reviewing that information allowed me to develop an understanding of business goals, user needs, and system requirements. This can transfer to real-world development of a business requirements document that includes objectives, functional, and non-functional requirements. This project also allowed me to work with C which is a language that I have not previously used.<br><br>
**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br>
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by applying coding best practices related to formatting, commenting, and functional logic. This project also follows Texas Instruments standard naming conventions and protocol implementations.<br>
